This is an ASCII game engine I made during my freshman year. A nice way to learn
how to deal with those crazy function pointers. That and dynamic libraries.

Comments in portuguese, since it was intended for my classmates, and I wouldn't
translate it now without completely rewriting and fixing the code.

Without ncurses, of course, because libs are for wimps! And so are makefiles!

Old and weird stuff, but you might like something.

I recently used that FPS bit for an assignment.
(yes, I used both ncurses and a makefile there...)
